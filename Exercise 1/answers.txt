Q&A of Exercise 1
Instructions: Answer these questions in a file answers.txt. [Generally, these questions should be answered in a few sentences each.]

1. 
Question: Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
Answer: I find Pandas are easier to work with, as it is more suitable to deal with tabular values and the return format looks better than Pandas. 
I think the codes of Pandas are easier to read, as there are fewer attributes in functions, and the codes are more similar to the human languages.

2. 
Question: What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
Answer: According to the results: Pandas cost 21.3 ms ± 875 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) and loops cost 526 ms ± 5.91 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each).
Pandas run much faster than loops. It is because that Pandas is built on the NumPy library and written in languages like Python, Cython, and C [1]. In other words, Pandas are built on the lower layer, which makes them run faster.
Additionally, there are no loops in the Pandas function, which reduces the running time as well.
